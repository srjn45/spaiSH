title: Roadmap
description: What's built and what's next for spai.
---


`spai` is a Claude-Code-style CLI agent. The roadmap below reflects that focus.
The earlier "AI-native OS" ambitions (FUSE, eBPF, PAM, a Wayland compositor, a
bootable ISO) are **parked** — see [Parked ideas](#parked-ideas) — in favour of
being an excellent terminal AI agent first.

## Shipped

The core agent is built and working:

- [x] Single in-process `spai` binary (no daemon, socket, or systemd)
- [x] Native tool-calling agent loop
- [x] Multi-provider support — Anthropic (native), OpenAI-compatible, Ollama
- [x] Tools — `bash`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `list_dir`
- [x] Parser-based command-safety classification (mvdan.cc/sh) with permission tiers
- [x] Execution modes — manual / auto / plan
- [x] Polished one-shot renderer — spinner, tool display, tier confirmations
- [x] Rich inline REPL — history, slash commands, `@file`, Ctrl+C interrupt
- [x] `spai init` onboarding wizard with live connection test
- [x] File-backed sessions with token-aware auto-compaction; `spai resume`
- [x] `spai !!`, stdin piping, `--local` / `--autonomous` / `--dry-run`
- [x] Streamed markdown rendering (glamour) in the renderer
- [x] Shift-Tab mode cycling and Esc-to-interrupt key handling
- [x] Prebuilt release binaries — tagged cross-compiled releases + CI
- [x] Live `/model` provider/model switching inside the REPL
- [x] Diff preview for `edit_file`/`write_file` before confirmation
- [x] MCP tool integration — connect external MCP servers, bridge their tools
- [x] More tools — `web_fetch`, `apply_patch` (structured patch/apply)
- [x] Expanded tool surface — `git`, `multi_edit`, `code_exec`, vision input,
      `todo_write`, `http_request`
- [x] Test-coverage and permission-classifier hardening pass
- [x] Project context & subagents — `SPAI.md` project-instructions file,
      `/init` scaffold command, `delegate` (subagent) tool with a hard depth-1
      limit, and per-project `.spai/settings.toml` permission overrides
- [x] Distribution & polish — shell completions (`completions/spai.{bash,zsh,fish}`),
      a `man` page (`docs/spai.1`), a Homebrew formula (`Formula/spai.rb`), and
      `.deb`/`.rpm` packaging via `nfpm` in `release.yml`
- [x] Prompt caching & performance — Anthropic `cache_control: ephemeral`
      breakpoints (system prompt, tools, conversation history), real
      input/output/cache-read/cache-creation token counts surfaced in `/cost`
      (replacing the chars/4 estimate), and a per-`Agent`-instance cache for
      the `SPAI.md` project-context disk lookup
- [x] Reliability & test coverage — `handleSlash` dispatch and the REPL print
      helpers in `internal/cli/slash.go` (46.7% → 59.3% package coverage),
      and provider streaming edge cases + shared helpers in `internal/ai`
      (74.6% → 89.4% package coverage)
- [x] REPL/UX polish — a `/sessions` REPL command listing recent sessions
      (pinned/current/shell markers, message count, relative age) without
      leaving the interactive session, and a `capOutputLines` cap (40 lines)
      on long `output`-type tool responses in the TTY renderer

## Next

The seeded backlog is shipped; these are the next directions, grouped
by leverage. Tier 1 is high-leverage, on-theme, and mostly
self-contained; Tier 2 adds meaningful features; Tier 3 is polish.

### Tier 1 — high leverage, mostly self-contained

- [ ] Checkpoint & `/undo` for file edits — snapshot each file before
      `write_file`/`edit_file`/`apply_patch`/`multi_edit` mutates it
      (originals under `.spai/checkpoints/<session>/`), and add `/undo`
      and `/redo` slash commands. Reuses the existing session plumbing.
      Files: `internal/tools/files.go`, `internal/session/`,
      `internal/cli/slash.go`.
- [ ] Custom slash commands / prompt templates — discover
      `.spai/commands/*.md` and expand them into prompts with
      `$ARGUMENTS` / `$1` substitution (e.g. `/review`, `/fix-tests`).
      Composes with the existing `SPAI.md` discovery. Files:
      `internal/cli/slash.go`, `internal/config/project.go`.
- [ ] Provider retry / backoff / rate-limit handling — no retry logic
      exists today, so a 429 or transient 5xx fails the turn. Add
      exponential backoff honouring `Retry-After` across all three
      providers. Files: `internal/ai/{anthropic,openai,ollama}.go` (or
      a shared wrapper).
- [ ] Optional execution sandbox — `bash` and `code_exec` are
      explicitly not sandboxed. Add an opt-in Linux sandbox (Landlock +
      seccomp, or `bwrap` when present) restricting filesystem and
      network access for `code_exec` and untrusted `bash`. Files:
      `internal/tools/{bash,code_exec}.go`, new `internal/sandbox/`.

### Tier 2 — meaningful features

- [ ] Background / long-running `bash` — a `run_in_background` option, a
      `/jobs` view, and streamed output. Files: `internal/tools/bash.go`.
- [ ] `gh` / PR integration tool — open branches, commit, and create
      PRs as an extension of the structured `git` tool.
- [ ] OpenAI `reasoning_effort` passthrough — Anthropic already gets
      adaptive thinking; OpenAI-compatible reasoning models get nothing.
      Files: `internal/ai/openai.go`.
- [ ] Named specialized subagents — today `delegate` is a single
      depth-1 generic; add named agent profiles (e.g. `reviewer`,
      `tester`) with their own system prompts and tool allowlists.
      Files: `internal/agent/subagent.go`.

### Tier 3 — polish

- [ ] Pre/post-tool-use hooks — e.g. auto-`gofmt` after edits, or
      block configured command patterns.
- [ ] Model routing — a cheap model for classification/safety, an
      expensive one for reasoning.
- [ ] REPL polish — multiline input, fuzzy `@file` completion, and
      syntax-highlighted diffs.
- [ ] Session memory — auto-learned facts persisted across sessions,
      beyond the static `SPAI.md`.

      system prompt

- [x] `delegate` — nested subagent tool, depth-limited to 1, sharing the
      parent's confirmation gate
- [x] Per-project `.spai/settings.toml` permission overrides, layered over
      global config
- [x] Shell completions — `completions/spai.{bash,zsh,fish}`, installed by
      `install.sh`
- [x] `man` page — `docs/spai.1`, installed by `install.sh`
- [x] Homebrew formula — `Formula/spai.rb` + `brew tap`/`install` instructions
- [x] `.deb`/`.rpm` packaging via `nfpm`, wired into `release.yml`
- [x] Anthropic prompt caching — `cache_control: ephemeral` breakpoints on the
      system prompt, tool definitions, and conversation history
- [x] Real token usage & cache-hit reporting in `/cost`, replacing the
      chars/4 estimate
- [x] Per-session `SPAI.md` project-context caching on the `Agent`, avoiding
      a disk re-read on every turn
- [x] REPL slash-command test coverage — `handleSlash` dispatch and print
      helpers in `internal/cli/slash.go`
- [x] Provider streaming edge cases and shared-helper test coverage in
      `internal/ai` (Anthropic/OpenAI/Ollama)
- [x] `/sessions` REPL command — list recent sessions without leaving the
      interactive session, reusing `session.ListSessions()`/`ReadPinned()`
- [x] Terminal-friendly long tool-output display — `capOutputLines` line cap
      in the REPL renderer, separate from the tool layer's byte-level cap

## Parked ideas

Genuinely interesting, but out of scope for now. The most promising — ambient
post-error help and repeated-pattern → alias suggestions — can return later as an
optional shell hook that shells out to `spai`, without fragile keystroke
sniffing.

- FUSE filesystem (`cat /ai/explain/<path>`)
- eBPF syscall/network observation and anomaly detection
- PAM module for context-aware authentication
- Wayland compositor integration / GUI terminal
- Bootable ISO with `spai` pre-installed

## Versioning

Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The first tagged release of the
refactored agent will be `v0.1.0`.
